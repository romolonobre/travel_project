TRAVEL APP PROJECT 

Simple travel app created with Flutter

This is a training project that i wanted to create to keep improving my flutter/Git study. I took a messy code i made some time ago and i've organized it 
into proper folders, files and added comments to make more understandable.

The app has three screens :
